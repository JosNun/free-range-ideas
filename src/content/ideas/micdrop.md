- **Purpose**: Capture fleeting “shower thoughts” and micro‑ideas (1–2 sentences) with almost zero friction.
- **Capture**: Quick voice memo from watch or phone; audio syncs automatically to your computer.
- **Transcribe**: Local Whisper/Parakeet with minimal cleanup to preserve the raw vibe.
- **Publish**: Creates a tiny entry (text‑first, optional embedded audio) in a separate "MicDrop" feed on your site.
- **Feed**: Dedicated MicDrop RSS/JSON; optionally podcast‑compatible via audio enclosure.
- **Safety**: Instant publish with a short undo window, or a one‑tap review toggle.
- **Constraints**: Short clips (≤ 90s); end‑to‑end from record to publish in ≲ ~2 minutes.

MicDrop is about documentation over deliberation. It lowers activation energy so your best off‑the‑cuff ideas are saved, searchable, and followable—without cluttering your main blog.
