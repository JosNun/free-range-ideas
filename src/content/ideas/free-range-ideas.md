Hey look, it's this site ðŸ‘€

- **Purpose**: Publish ideas Iâ€™ll likely never get to so others can run with them.
- **Terms**: Free to use. Credit is optional but appreciated. Extra kudos for open source or shipping something real.
- **Format**: Each idea has a short why, constraints, and starter notes. Keep it lightweight and actionable.
- **Showcase?**: If you build one, share a link back. Iâ€™ll collect implementations and lessons learned.

A living, public backlog: things I want in the world but donâ€™t have time for right now. If something here sparks you, grab it and go. Let me know what you makeâ€”Iâ€™d love to cheer it on.
