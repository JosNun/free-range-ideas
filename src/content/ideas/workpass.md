- **Gate, don't block**: Distinguishes bots from humans like traditional CAPTCHA, but offers bots a crypto-mining challenge instead of blocking them.
- **Micro-mining access**: Bots solve hash-based proof-of-work puzzles that contribute to real cryptocurrency networks.
- **Direct payments**: Site owners receive cryptocurrency micropayments for each bot that "pays to play."
- **Transparent for humans**: Legitimate users pass through silently via behavioral analysis, browser fingerprinting, or session patterns—no CAPTCHA friction.
- **Cost-to-revenue flip**: Transform expensive bot traffic into a monetizable resource.
- **Scalable difficulty**: Mining challenge adjusts based on site value, traffic patterns, and current crypto network conditions.

WorkPass turns the bot problem on its head—instead of burning resources to keep scrapers out, make them contribute computational value to get in. Your hosting costs become their mining costs.
