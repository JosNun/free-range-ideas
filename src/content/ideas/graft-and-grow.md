- Plant and grow your own body augments instead of looting them.
- Roguelike runs yield seeds you plant in a garden between runs.
- Harvest grown augments and install them into limited body slots.
- Bench installed parts to re‑plant them for upgrades or cross‑breeding.
- Cross/merge parts to create unique traits with trade‑offs.
- Planted or benched parts are unusable for the next run while they grow.
- Progress carries through the garden, not the run; builds evolve over cycles.
- Growth time is measured in runs, not real‑time.
