				I have a bunch of project ideasâ€”most of which I'll never get to. This site is where I publish them and say "these are free for the taking." They're things I want to exist but don't have the time for right now. Bonus points if you make them open source or turn one into a successful product ðŸš€. Extra bonus points if you give me a shoutout for the original idea.

			<p class="text-sm text-gray-500 mb-4">
				Also, this is a quick hobby project, so the design and UX is... lacking.

			<p class="text-sm text-gray-500 mb-4">
				As an added disclaimer, all the ideas are original, but I may have used AI to help flesh them out.
